# Credit Card Default Prediction - Bank Danamon

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting credit card payment defaults among the clients of Bank Danamon. The project utilizes historical data, demographic features, payment patterns, and financial indicators to develop a predictive model that anticipates the likelihood of credit card defaults.

## Problem Statement

The primary goal is to reduce the count of customers labeled as defaults at Bank Danamon. By creating an accurate predictive model, the bank aims to proactively identify high-risk customers and implement strategies to manage risks effectively, thus minimizing potential credit losses.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast credit card payment defaults. This model will empower Bank Danamon to make informed decisions, take preventive measures, and optimize risk management strategies.

## Features

The project includes the following key features:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment using streamlit
- Interactive user interface for input and prediction
